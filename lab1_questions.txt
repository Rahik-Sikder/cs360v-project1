Pre-lab Questions:

1. The cpuid() assembly instruction returns information about the processor's capabilities, storing the results into the eax, ebx, ecx, and edx registers. The data outputted to these registers will change based off the input value in eax set by info. The data is then copied from the registers into the local c uint32_t variables passed in (eax, ebx, ecx, edx). It's used in the function vmx_check_support() to determine whether the processor supports VMX operations.

2. In cpuid() the asm volatile places the return values, meant for the eax, ebx, ecx, edx registers, into created uint32_t variables (eax, ebx, ecx, edx). Then the values are assigned to dereferenced input pointers.

3.
eax = 0xd
ebx = 0x756e6547
ecx = 0x6c65746e
edx = 0x49656e69

4. First need to change endian-ness

ebx = 0x756e6547 => 47656e75
edx = 0x49656e69 => 696e6549
ecx = 0x6c65746e => 6e74656c

Gets the following string: "GenuineIntel"

This corresponds to the processor manufacturing ID string for Intel processors as well as the Apple Rosetta 2 virtual machine. 

5. The VmxGuestInfo struct holds the following information:
- The physical size of the VM
- The pointer to the corresponding vmcs
- An exception bitmap for what what excpetions should cause a VM exit
- Two IO bitmaps for what what I/O accesses should cause a VM exit
- MSR related fields. How many MSRs are present, what to load when going to Guest, what to load when going to Host
- The number of virtual cpus assigned to the guest OS, needed to determine multi-threading capabilities

6. The vmcs pointer points to data structure called the "Virtual-Machine Control Structure". This data structure contains information about the state of the guest OS and is used to manage transitions between VMX entry and exit operations.  

7. The VMPTRLD instruction initializes the VMCS pointer and is called in vmx.c, loading the pointer to the VMCS into the processor VMCS pointer. VMPTRLD changes the active VMCS and determines which structure instructions such as vmwrite, vmread, etc, will apply to.
